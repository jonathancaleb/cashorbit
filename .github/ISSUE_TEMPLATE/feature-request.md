NOTE TO THE SUBMITTER
**Please check past issues to ensure you are not duplicating feature requests. Duplicates will not be addressed again.**
Not all feature requests will be considered. This budget app was created with careful thought given to each feature's usability and prevention of feature overload. As you use the app, you will discover possibly related useful features and that may not be obvious right away.
